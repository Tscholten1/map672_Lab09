        <p>The materials that are represent on this page illustrate my cartography and geo-spatial work both as they currently exist and as I transition to working with more web-based geo-spatial analysis and cartography tools, methods, and concepts.</p>
        <p>The first two projects provide recent examples of common geo-spatial and cartography work as a civilian crime analsyst with a local police department. The third map is an exmaple of a complex location analysis that I performed for a graduate-level course at the Pennsylvania State University in the Spring of 2016. Project 4 is a very recent example of web-based mapping that involves creating a web-based interactive map of US electric power generation that shows plants that use coal, solar, and nuclear power. Content on this page will change over time as my skill-set with HTML, CSS, and Javascript becomes more complex and I develop greater compentency with develop web-based products. Stay tuned and visit this page often!!

       <h3>PROJECT 1--Map of Crime and Quality of Life in the 2800 block of East Washington Avenue Incidents</h3>
       
        <p>This map illustrates the work that I have performed as a crime analyst with the City of Madison Police Department. It uses quality of life and some categories of crime data generated by the police CAD system so that it captures all calls that were generated by citizens who call 911. This map helps decision-makers in the police department assess call volume and the crime dynamics occuring at this location. Creating maps such as this involve a balance of visual appeal while also providing as much relevant information as possible.</p>
        <p>This map was created using ArcGIS and LERMS/police data</p>

     <h3>PROJECT 2--Map of Crime and Quality of Life Incidents in the Darbo Neighborhood</h3>
        
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Similar to the previous map in Project 1, this map displays data from different periods of time (i.e. months) in a micro-place that has experienced elevated call volume and serious crime and quality of life incidents in a relatively small area known as a micro-place. </p>

    <h3>PROJECT 3--Balancing Habitat Preservation with Transportation Needs in Centre County Pennsylvania (GEO 472)</h3>
        
        <h3></h3>
        <p>The goal of this map is to visualize on a map product those areas in Centre County, Pennsylvania that meet specified criteria. More specifically, the analysis will be used by the Centre County Planning Office to explore a proposed biological reserve system within Centre County. Areas that meet specific criteria would be protected based on a variety of factors including the number of different plant and mammal species and habitat quality. The map produced from this geospatial analysis will assist the decision making process of government officials in evaluating the proposed biological reserve system.  This map illustrates multiple variables related to land use and habitat population as they relate to transportation planning</p>
        
        <p>
        One of the challenging, but also practical elements of this lesson was working with both vector and raster data. Vector data include such phenomena as points (specific locations), lines (highways and roads), and polygons (park boundaries, habitat areas, zoning districts). Raster data represent a continuum of some phenomena such as temperature, climate, or elevation and are represented by cells that have some value and comprise a grid or matrix-like layer. Working with raster data requires an understanding that the cell size of a raster layer can affect the analysis process and can affect the granularity of the level of detail of layers.
            
        Summary of GIS methods used:
Numerous GIS methods were used in compiling the results of this less. Among them were:
</p><li>Joining a table (specie rich) with no geographic attribute to a shapefile (Study Areas) based on a unique field (BLOCK_ID).</li>
<li>Using the Select by Attribute and Select by Location operation in the attribute tables of several layers</li>
<li>Adding new fields to several attribute tables (e.g. areas with 70 or more species)</li>
<li>Using the Field Calculator to compute new data based on existing fields in several attribute tables</li>
<li>Observing commonly accepted cartographic principles such as visual hierarchy, inclusion of north arrow and scale bar, and proper use of space around elements</li>
<li>Creating buffers around transportation centerlines (e.g. roads, highways, interstates) using the buffer tool in the Analysis/Proximity toolbox</li>
<li>Using the Union tool to combine multiple buffer layers for each of the three road types into one layer (Unioned_Buffer_Within_SpeAre1)</li>
<li>Using the reclassify operation to create categories of different data types (Reclass_10 percent slope)</li>
            
   <p></p>
    <p>Project criteria were defined as:</p>
         <p>
        </p><li>Greater than 70 bird and mammalian species combined<a< li="">
        </a<></li><li>Less than 10% of each study area occupied by buffered roads, highways, and interstates<a< li="">
        </a<></li><li>High habitat potential<a< li="">
        </a<></li><li>Publicly-owned land<a< li="">
        </a<></li><li>Forested areas<a< li="">
        </a<></li><li>Slope less than 10%<a< li="">      
         <p></p>
        
        <p>The map was created using ArcGIS as well as U.S. Census and Pennsylvania state and county level data.</p>

        <h3>PROJECT 4--Map of power plants displayed using a propotional symbol size to encode visually the amount of power produced from a particular fuel source (i.e. coal, solar, nuclear).(MAP 672, Lab 3)</h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>This map was built using custom Javascript code drawing upon the Leaflet Javascript Library as well as CSS and HTML styling rules</p>
         <p>Map features include:</p>

      <p>
    </p><li>Display power plant power generation using proportional symbol size to encode visually the amount of power produced from a particular fuel source</li>
    <li>Allow the user to compare three distinct fuel sources (of any amount of generating capacity) by visually encoding the proportional symbols with distinct colors (i.e., make the symbol for each fuel source a different color).</li>
    <li>Provide the user with a layer control to toggle on and off the visibility of various power plant data layers</li>
    <li>style the label text within the layer control to correspond with the color used to encode a specific power fuel source when the user clicks on the map once, the map display will change to only show plants within 500 km of the click event after the user clicks on the map to filter by distance and then clicks on any power plant currently visible, a popup will show specific information about the plant. this information should include the plant's name, its fuel source, and the distance from the plant to the the click point.</li>
<p></p>
   
<p>The map was created using JavaScript, Leaflet, CSS, and HTML.</p>
